# Neural Network

Variable neural network written in Python. Uses Numpy.

## Usage

Type command "python3.12 NN_Framework.py" in the terminal (or run file
directly)(Numpy should be installed; if not, use "pip install numpy").

You will need to insert numbers as input based on the network structure
assigned inside the Network_Input.txt file. (A basic structure to use as
template has already been given.)
